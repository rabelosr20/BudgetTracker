# BudgetTracker
Written in Python. This code allows a user to go through and enter a budget for whatever month they choose. Itâ€™ll tell them if they are on track with their budget or if they need to cut costs. If they are on track with their budget it allows them to choose whether or not they would like to cut costs. If they are not it asks them what they would like their target to be. From there it uses the priority assigned to the expenses to cut costs so the user can have a budget that is on track.

This version does not contain a GUI and the user inputs will be done through the terminal. Although there is also a version with a GUI published here.
